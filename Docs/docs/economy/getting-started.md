Before you can begin selling or earning in VRChat, youâ€™ll also need to complete a few easy steps with our payment partner, Tilia. Tilia helps comply with local laws and prevent fraud so you can have a safe selling experience.

## Seller Onboarding

To start seller onboarding, you'll need to supply Tilia with some personal information (Personal Identifying Information, or PII):

1. Go to the **Marketplace** tab in the left-hand sidebar and click **Storefront**.
