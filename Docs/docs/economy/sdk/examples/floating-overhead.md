<SellerNotification/>

Floating Overhead Buy Indicator is a prefab that spawns an indicator over a player's head once they have purchased something. Customize it in various ways to highlight your supporters.

### How to Import
1. Download the [Unity package directly by clicking here](https://cdn.sanity.io/files/yvg0vlb9/production/44b4e129593cff2c69c2809e0e432bec7390c271.unitypackage).
2. Make sure your project is using the World SDK `3.5.0`or newer.
3. Import the Unity package into your project.

##### Prefabs Included
* **FloatingOverheadBuyIndicatorPrefab**: A script that adds the `FloatingObjectPrefab` above players who own the `ExampleProduct`.

* **FloatingObjectPrefab**: What's spawned above the player when they own the product. You can customize this or replace it with another GameObject to be anything you'd like.

:::caution
If viewing the example scene, you'll also need the [Open Group Page](/economy/sdk/examples/open-group-page) prefab. Otherwise, your project will be missing what it needs for a complete scene.

### How to Use

For this (and most!) prefabs, you'll first need an UdonProduct to check for and a way for players to subscribe to this product. 

Once you've created a purchasable product:

1. Drag the **FloatingOverheadBuyIndicatorPrefab** into your scene. It's invisible by default as there's no image or model to display yet.

2. In the Inspector, locate the **Product** variable. Click on the circle button and replace the example file with your own product.

![ProductAdd](/img/economy/examples/BuyIndicator-ProductAdd.png "Dragging the prefab into scene.")

3. Next, locate **Overhead Indicator Prefab**. This is what will spawn over the players head when they purchase this product. Think of it like the green diamond from the Sims! You can replace this with whatever GameObject you'd like, but just make sure it has no colliders.

4. Use **Height Above Head** to customize how far above the player's head you want the indicator to float.

5. If you'd like the player to be able to look up and see their own indicator, leave **Show Indicator Above Local Player** enabled. Disable it if otherwise.
