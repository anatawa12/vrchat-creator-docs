<SellerNotification/>

When a VRChat user buys something from a creator, they usually receive a **product**. The Creator Economy currently has two types of products:
- [Paid role products](/economy/products/paid-roles) give users a role in your VRChat Group. You can use paid roles to give users access to your Group, Group instances, special Group announcements, prioritized instance queues, or other benefits related to Groups.
- [Udon products](/economy/products/udon) give users benefits in your VRChat worlds. You can use Udon products to unlock new areas, customize your world, or display a message. The SDK includes simple prefabs for using Udon Products. If you're experienced with [Udon](/worlds/udon), you can use Udon Products in your custom Udon scripts.
