Paid roles are the easiest way to monetize your VRChat Group. By creating and activating a paid role, users will be able to support you with VRChat Credits and become members of your Group. Paid roles are directly tied to your **Listings**, with each one being a listing that you can edit and add UdonProducts to.

## Creating a paid role

1. Navigate to [vrchat.com/home](https://vrchat.com/home)
2. Go to your **Groups** tab in the left-hand sidebar.
3. After choosing a Group you own, go to **Settings** > **Roles**.
4. Choose **Create Paid Role**.
    1. Note: You will be prompted to agree to the Tilia Terms of Service before you can set up paid roles. [Read on setting up with Tilia here.](/economy/getting-started)

Listings are tied directly to your Paid Roles, but have plenty of other customization options! You can find out how to edit your listings on the [Your Store](/economy/store) tab.
