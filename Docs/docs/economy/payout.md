Creators can pay out VRChat Earnings in USD through Paypal by visiting [Payout](https://vrchat.com/home/marketplace/storefront/payout) and requesting a payout from Tilia, VRChat's payment processor.

## Payout requirements

- Sellers can pay out once per day.
- Only authorized sellers may request a payout.
- Sellers must have earned at least 30,000 VRChat Credits.
	- Only earned VRChat Credits (from selling to other users) can be paid out.
