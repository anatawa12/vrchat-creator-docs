## Creator Economy SDK ##

#### What's the Creator Economy SDK? ####
The [Creator Economy SDK](/economy/sdk/) allows VRChat worlds to react to users who supported you.
Once the Creator Economy is publicly available, it will be part of the regular VRChat SDK.

#### What can World creators do with the Creator Economy SDK? ####
- Create Udon products on [VRChat.com](https://vrchat.com/home/) and link them to Udon products in your world.
- React to players owning products in your world.
    - Unlock exclusive areas, items, or features.
- Allow users to 'use' a purchased product.
    - For example, if a player purchased a 'fireworks' item, they may trigger it for all players.
- Open your group page directly, making it easy for customers to support you.

Visit the [Creator Economy SDK documentation](/economy/sdk/) to get started!

#### Can I use Udon products from someone else's group? ####
No. You must be the world owner and the group owner to use an Udon product.
You **can** open another user's Group or store with the [Open Group Page](sdk/udon-documentation#storeopengrouppage) method.

#### What aspects of my World is the Creator Economy SDK allowed to control? ####
The intent of the Creator Economy SDK is to reward users for supporting you. Don't abuse it!
Remember to keep users safe. If a user doesn't support you, don't make them physically uncomfortable.
Avoid confusing users. Give users clear information about exclusive features.

## Miscellaneous ##

#### Does a user have to be part of a group to make a purchase? ####
Not initially! You do not need to be part of a group before making a purchase on their store. Making the purchase, though, will automatically add you to the group. If you leave the group, you will lose access to your Paid Role in the group, but not the Udon Products.

#### Can I split my earnings with another creator? ####
There is currently no split pay functionality. The [Payout](/economy/payout) process is only available to the **group owner.**

#### Can a listing be free? ####
No, not at this time. However, for testing, sellers can purchase their own listings for free in VRChat.

#### Where can I provide feedback? ####
VRChat uses Canny for our community feedback and bug reports. Feel free to post on the Creator Economy section of our [feedback page.](https://feedback.vrchat.com/creator-economy)

#### Are all purchases subscriptions, or are one-time purchases possible? ####
All subscriptions are monthly and have an expiration date. Users can pre-pay for as many months as they want (or years!)

Auto-renewing subscriptions are something we hope to support in the future.

#### If a creator deletes a product, will that automatically update/delete any listings that contain that product? ####
Creators cannot delete products that have active subscribers. They will see an error informing them that the product has active purchases and that it cannot be deleted. Instead, creators may wish to delete the listing that the product is contained in.
