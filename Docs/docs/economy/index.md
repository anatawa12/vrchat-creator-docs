The Creator Economy allows group owners to set up a store in VRChat. They can sell subscriptions to their supporters, which reward them with benefits in the group and in the creator's VRChat worlds.

Users can buy subscriptions by spending VRChat Credits. Creators can earn VRChat Credits and [pay them out](/economy/payout) with Tilia and PayPal, if eligible.

- [Get started](/economy/getting-started) and set up your first group subscription.
- [Manage your store](/economy/store) and customize the rewards your supporters receive.
- [Use the Worlds SDK](/economy/sdk) to add rewards to your VRChat worlds.
- [Read the seller FAQ](/economy/faq) for sellers.
- [Read the VRChat Credit FAQ](https://help.vrchat.com/hc/en-us/articles/23255458227987-Creator-Economy-Frequently-Asked-Questions) for users.

The Creator Economy is still in development. In the future, whether creators make avatars, worlds, or other experiences, VRChat will offer different solutions to empower creators.
