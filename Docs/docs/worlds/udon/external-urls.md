# External URLs
Udon can use external URLs to load remote content. URLs must be wrapped in a [VRCUrl](#vrcurl) object. Users can enter URLs into `VRCUrlInputField` components at runtime, and world creators can provide pre-defined VRCUrls with their uploaded worlds.

## Allowlist
For security reasons, VRChat restricts how external URLs can be used. By default, a [VRCUrl](#vrcurl) can only be accessed if it is on VRChat's domain allowlist.
If a URL is **not** on the required allowlist for its type, it cannot be used unless the user chooses to "Allow Untrusted URLs" in VRChat's settings. This allows Udon to use load untrusted URL from `VRCUrlInputField` components and any `VRCUrl` that was uploaded alongside the world.
